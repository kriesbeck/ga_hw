##Kaggle Competition: AirBnB New User Bookings

###What is the question you hope to answer? 
In which country will a new AirBnB user make their first booking?

###What data are you planning to use to answer that question? 
AirBnB has provided 5 data sets:
* train_users.csv - the training set of users
* test_users.csv - the test set of users
* sessions.csv - web sessions log for users
* countries.csv - summary statistics of destination countries in this dataset and their locations
* age_gender_bkts.csv - summary statistics of users' age group, gender, country of destination

###What do you know about the data so far? 
AirBnB has provided descriptions of the fields in the datasets provided.  
The train data has over 200,000 rows.

###Why did you chose this topic? 
"Participate in a Kaggle competition" is on my data science bucket list, and this project - predicting user behavior from web data -  piqued my interest.
Additionally, this is an active Kaggle competition with a deadline in February, and I'd like to see how well my model performs in real time.
